       PROJECTS

1️⃣ Restaurant Availability Checker
Automation Project | API Integration | Workflow Design
👤 Role & Ownership
Project Type: Independent / Portfolio Project
Role: Automation & Workflow Designer
Tools: n8n, Appify, REST APIs
I designed and implemented an end-to-end automation workflow that determines whether restaurants in a specific location are open or closed, using scheduled execution, API integration, and data validation logic.
🎯 Business Problem
Many food discovery and service platforms struggle to keep restaurant availability accurate due to:
Frequently changing operating hours
Manual status updates
Data duplication and inconsistency
This leads to poor user experience and unreliable listings.
💡 Solution Summary
I built an automated workflow that:
Pulls restaurant data from an external API
Evaluates operating hours against real-time conditions
Automatically updates restaurant availability status
Maintains clean, duplicate-free records
The solution is scalable, low-maintenance, and suitable for production environments.
⚙️ Workflow Architecture (High Level)
Scheduled Trigger
Ensures availability checks run automatically at defined intervals.
API Integration (HTTP Request)
Fetches restaurant data from an Appify-based application.
Filtering & Validation Logic
Confirms correct location and determines open/closed status.
Append Logic
Inserts new restaurant records without overwriting existing data.
Update Logic
Detects status changes and updates records efficiently.
🧠 Technical Skills Demonstrated
Workflow automation & orchestration (n8n)
API consumption & HTTP request handling
Conditional logic & time-based evaluation
Data integrity (append vs update logic)
Scalable low-code system design
📊 Impact & Results
Eliminated manual restaurant availability checks
Improved data accuracy and consistency
Enabled real-time open/closed visibility
Designed a reusable workflow adaptable to other industries (retail, services, events)
📌 Practical Use Cases

Smart city or tourism solutions
Local service directories
Time-sensitive listing applications
🚀 Future Enhancements (Roadmap)
